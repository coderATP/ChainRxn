next:
1. game complete scene done
2. pause watch when a game is complete
3. tutorial/instructions
4. set rules:
market movement to foundation starts game on player tap screen
player starts round.
click one of 5 cards that match that on foundation
chain and broken chain spritesheet
if clicked card is valid, chain animates
...from foundation to card
onComplete, chain shortens back to 0,
...dragging the card along with it to foundation

participant can keep dealing as long as cards are valid
has 1 chance per turn to swap a card with market
swap button is enabled if the chance hasn't been used
undo move button to return market and foundation movements
undo moves calculated per turn basis. how many (foundation + swap) moves a player made, can be undone
redo button as well.
end/skip turn button as well. player does not necessary have to deal in a round

once player's turn ends, computer starts
hell:
computer is very logical:
also doesn't have to deal or swap
computer first swaps before dealing, or simply deals
go through all the cards and sort by value
array.sort((a,b)=> a.getData("value") - b.getData("value"))


can swap/deal
swap: tap which card to swap
deal: tap which card to deal
undo: undo last action
redo: redo last action
end/skip: button
highlight which player's turn it is.
